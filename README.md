Systems: Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, AQLAlchemy, Flask

## Overview
We are analysing data to see if W.Avy our investor will invest in our Surf and ice cream business. We did a weather analysis of the previous year for the city of Oahu. We believe this location is the best city to create a business, Awahoo. We did temperature trends of June and December to determine that our shop is a sustainable year-round business. We were able to create a flask file to help out our investor with understanding the data easier. We want W.Avy to invest in our shop even though he has some concerns about the weather. 

## Results
  - Generate temperature trends in June and December
  - Generate temperature of Oahu year round
  - Analysis amount of precipitation on Oahu
  - Analysis starts date in August 23, 2017
  - Create a Flask file
  
## Summary
In conclusion, we were able to generate the temperature of June and December for the city of Oahu. They were both similar with very little difference between them. We can see that our business plan is solid for year-round. However, we should analysis quarterly to be more sure that we are able to sell year-round. It would give us more solid analysis. We should even further our analysis by include other cities' temperature to make sure that the location is correct.
