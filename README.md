Systems: Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, AQLAlchemy, Flask

## Overview
We are analysing data to see if W.Avy our investor will invest in our Surf and ice cream business. We did a weather analysis of the previous year for the city of Oahu. We believe this location is the best city to create a business, Awahoo. We did temperature trends of June and December to determine that our shop is a sustainable year-round business. We were able to create a flask file to help out our investor with understanding the data easier. We want W.Avy to invest in our shop even though he has some concerns about the weather.
